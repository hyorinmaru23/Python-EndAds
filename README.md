# EndAds

## Description
EndAds is an alternative to AdBlock.
It uses windows local DNS to block any known ads, referenced in http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/.

There is another version of EndAds, EndAds (hBlock) which uses https://hblock.molinero.xyz/hosts. (Use this only if you have a good Computer and a good internet connection because ads that will be written in windows hosts are very large)

## Overview

## Issues

Not really an issue but EndAds mainly block english ads.
